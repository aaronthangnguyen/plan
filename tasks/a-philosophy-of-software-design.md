# A Philosophy of Software Design

```üìù Only a few chapters are useful at the moment```

- [x] 11. Design it twice
- [x] 12. Why write comments?
- [ ] 13. Comments should describe things that aren't obvious from the code

## NOTES

### 12. Why write comments?

- If users must read the code of a method in order to use it, then there is no abstraction
- Comments capture information that was in the mind of the designer, but couldn't be represented in the code
- Well-written comments are not failures

### 13. Comments should describe things that aren't obvious from the code
